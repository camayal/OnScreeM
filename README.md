# On Screen measurements

This little script was created with the aim of helping to take measurements with scale directly from any app in the screen of the computer.

The first two points determine the scale in pixel equivalent to 1 cm, and then consecutive points determine independent measurements. 
The app is minimizable, so user could change photo, app, tab, etc., and take even more measurements.
At the end pressing the key `Tab` it will report the range and outliners if there are any.

Hotkeys:
`Tab` -> Copy to the clipboard min, max and if possible min outlier and max outlier  
`Backspace` -> Remove from memory last measurement  
`Space` -> Minimize measurement area  
`Esc` -> Clean measuremnt area and restart scale. Useful to measure multiple photos with different scales. This do not clean measurements in the memory
